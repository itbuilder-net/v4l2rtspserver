## Create a service to start the rtspserver automatically

Copy the script, you can also set the resolution and other parameters in this file:

`sudo cp control_v4l2rtpserver.sh /usr/sbin`

Copy the .service file:

`sudo cp v4l2rtspserver.service /etc/systemd/system`

Reload the services:

`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

Start the service and check its status:

`sudo systemctl start v4l2rtspserver`
`sudo systemctl status v4l2rtspserver`

If the service started successfully enable it for running at startup:

`sudo systemctl enable v4l2rtspserver`

The rtspserver should be available now at:

[rtsp://raspberrypi.local:8554](rtsp://raspberrypi.local:8554)

Check with VLC or other media players
